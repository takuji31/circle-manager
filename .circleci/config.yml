    # These next lines define a Docker executor: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/
    # You can specify an image from Dockerhub or use one of our Convenience Images from CircleCI's Developer Hub.
    # A list of available CircleCI Docker Convenience Images are available here: https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/node
